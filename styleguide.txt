* Spaces not tabs (if you switch to python tabs will cause you great pain)
* 4 spaces for indenting code (or pick a number and stick to it)
* 80 column lines (exceptions are for formated inline text or markup)
* Braces follow Linux kernel style with braces on same line as if, for, while but on new line after function/methods
  This makes code more compact and methods easier to copy to header file by just adding simicolon at end of line
*
